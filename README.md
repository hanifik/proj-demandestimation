# proj-demandestimation

## Demand Estimation for Differentiated Products in Empirical IO
Graduation Project:
- A conceptual review on the specification and interpretation of multinomial regression models such as probit and (hierarchical) logit for the analysis of categorical dependent variables, such as demand estimation using aggregate data

Technical Highlights:
- Implementing an estimation algorithm in Julia that optimizes a non-convex objective function, numerically integrates choice probabilities (simulation), and solves a system of nonlinear equations to derive (aggregate) product market shares
